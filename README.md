## What is DataBasic?

According to [its website,](https://databasic.io) “DataBasic is a suite of easy-to-use web tools for beginners that introduce concepts of working with data. These simple tools make it easy to work with data in fun ways, so you can learn how to find great stories to tell.” DataBasic is developed and supported by MIT’s [Center for Civic Media](https://civic.mit.edu/) and Emerson College’s [Engagement Lab.](https://elab.emerson.edu/) 


## Data

Download the El Gesticulador text file.

Open the file in a text editor (Notepad on PC, TextEdit on Mac). 

From the text editor, you can get a sense of how the text data is structured.

## Getting Started with Data Basic

### WordCounter

<p align="center"><img class=" size-full wp-image-53 aligncenter" src="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/DataBasic-tutorial/blob/master/screenshots/Capture_4.jpg?raw=true" alt="Capture" /></p>

Click on the WordCounter icon to open the WordCounter tool. 

As described on the page, “WordCounter analyzes your text and tells you the most common words and phrases. This tool helps you count words, bigrams, and trigrams in plain text. This is often the first step in quantitative text analysis.”

Bigrams are two-word phrases or expressions. Trigrams are three-word phrases or expressions.

WordCounter gives you the option to use a sample text, paste in your own text, upload a file, or load text from a URL.

We will be using the lyrics from the Barrio Fino album in WordCounter. 

<p align="center"><img class=" size-full wp-image-53 aligncenter" src="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/DataBasic-tutorial/blob/master/screenshots/Capture_5.jpg?raw=true" alt="Capture" /></p>

Click on the option to upload a file, and select the bario_fino_lyrics.txt file saved to your Desktop.

<p align="center"><img class=" size-full wp-image-53 aligncenter" src="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/DataBasic-tutorial/blob/master/screenshots/Capture_6.jpg?raw=true" alt="Capture" /></p>

The default options selected in WordCounter will analyze the text without considering capitalization and stopwords.

Stopwords are commonly used words. English-language examples include “and,” “the”, and “this.”

Leave both options selected and click the Count icon.

<p align="center"><img class=" size-full wp-image-53 aligncenter" src="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/DataBasic-tutorial/blob/master/screenshots/Capture_7.jpg?raw=true" alt="Capture" /></p>

The first visualization generated by WordCount is a word cloud of the most frequently occurring terms in the document you uploaded. Hover over specific words with your cursor to see how many times they appear in the document.

<p align="center"><img class=" size-full wp-image-53 aligncenter" src="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/DataBasic-tutorial/blob/master/screenshots/Capture_8.jpg?raw=true" alt="Capture" /></p>

The tables below the word cloud on the results page include a list of words that appear most frequently in the document. WordCount has also generated a table with a list of bigrams and trigrams, as well as how many times they appear in the document.

<p align="center"><img class=" size-full wp-image-53 aligncenter" src="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/DataBasic-tutorial/blob/master/screenshots/Capture_8a.jpg?raw=true" alt="Capture" /></p>

You can click on the arrow icon next to any of the table titles to download a CSV (comma-separate value) file with the data contained in that table. This file can be opened in a spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel.

<blockquote> What is a CSV? 

A comma-separated value file (CSV) is a structured tabular data format in which column values are separated by a comma. Computer programs like Microsoft Excel parse those values and display the underlying data in a spreadsheet format. Saving tabular data as a CSV file type avoids much of the additional formatting added by programs like Microsoft Excel. </blockquote>

You can also click on the arrow icon next to the page title to get a link to your WordCounter results. Your results are available via that link for 60 days.
